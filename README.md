********Welcome to python OS*********
This pythonos is not  a real os but i would simulate a unix-like os , u are free to help in my project
Launching python os:
just launch pythonOs script in Base system folder
warning "first make pythonos folder in /storage/emulated/0"
and then copy all files in that folder

Using install command in PythonOs-:
1. install command require two files
 first one is python script or program u want install
 second one is dependency file which have all 
dependency package written in it for running the program.
e.g i had to install a script which takes out derivative of Equation
so i get that script "derivative.py" and 
after reading script `s first lines i came to know 
that this script uses sympy module so i just made a text file
such as sample.txt and just write sympy to it
and then i start pythonOs cd to directory where both the required files are and run the below command
"install derivative.py sample.txt"
if everything is going well then you will see "'install succesful"
Launching installed apps in PythonOs:-
use "launch" to see list of apps installed
and use "launch app" to launch app
e.g to launch derivative app
launch derivative.
use help in PythonOs to know more
new features coming soon游때游때游때游때
